# Enterprise Information Security
Infosec assists Mozillians in defining and operating security controls to ensure that data at Mozilla is protected consistently across the organization.

- we help you define the risks around your services and data
- we help projects design and implement security controls
- we maintain a risk-based inventory of systems and their functional security controls to help Mozilla management determine where to invest in security measures
- we develop a catalog of services and tools that help you appropriately secure your data
- we respond to security investigations and incidents
- we provide baseline practices and assist teams in defining their security standards
